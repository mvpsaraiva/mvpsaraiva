									<h3>AXS: An Agent-Based Simulation Model for Urban Flows</h3>
									<p>Although ephemeral, urban flows can have a lasting effect on city organisation, affecting decisions taken by people regarding where to live, set up business and carry out activities. Thus, flows can be identified as an important factor shaping urban form while being shaped themselves by a series of urban and environmental factors. These include: land uses, which have an effect on trip generation by setting origins and destinations; infrastructure and terrain characteristics, which can make it easier or harder to use different routes; cultural aspects and collective memory, which can make people prefer one route over another and so on.</p>
									<p>My PhD research proposes an agent-based simulation model, entitled AXS, which aims to replicate urban patterns, such as the ones generated by accessibility and centrality measures, from the bottom-up by simulating the movements of individuals in cities. Thus, this research aims to simulate flows from the bottom-up, but to analyse the results on a larger scale and aggregated form. The proposed model is capable of generating artificial flows constrained only by urban morphological properties, but it can also be extended to simulate more complex movement patterns by differentiating agentsâ€™ behaviours and preferences, by generating trips based on real land use distribution, by including different transport modes, and so on. The flows patterns produced by the AXS model are compared to patterns of accessibility and centrality measures, as well as commercial and residential land uses distributions and traffic flows in real cities. The model allows for the disaggregation of the study of flows using different types of groups (such as socio-economic or ethnic groups) as well as to study the relationship between urban morphology and flows of movement.</p>
